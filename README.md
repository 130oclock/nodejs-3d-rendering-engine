## General info
This is a 3d rendering engine with a few extra features. It utilizes node.js to create a browser based 3d rendering engine in the HTML5 canvas.<br />
I have also implemented [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids), an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds.
